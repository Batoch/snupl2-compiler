# Term Project: Building a Compiler for SnuPL/2

In this term project, we implemented a simple compiler for the SnuPL/2 language. 
Our compiler compile SnuPL/2 source code to 64-bit assembly code.

SnuPL/2 is an imperative procedural language closely related to the [Oberon programming language](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth/Oberon/index.html), one of the many languages developed by Prof. Niklaus Wirth. 
SnuPL/2 does not support object-orientation and the only composite data type supported are arrays. 
Records or enumerations are not supported. 
Nevertheless, SnuPL/2 is complex enough to illustrate the basic concepts of a compiler.

The project will be conducted in several phases as follows

### Submission

Push your submission to our Gitlab server at https://teaching.csap.snu.ac.kr/ and tag it with "Submission-Phase-2".  If you discover a bug and push an improved version, delete the tag on the old commit and re-create it on the commit that we are to evaluate.

The date of the commit counts as the submission date. If you push changes after the official deadline, let the TAs know by email.
